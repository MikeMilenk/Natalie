	<h3>My life path</h3>
	<p>Look at this building. Here I spent 3 years of my life.</p>
	<img src="https://medacademy.ck.ua/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/header_big_grad-e1484818530751.jpg" width="1406" height="512">
	<p>I studied to be a pharmacist and even got my associate's diploma.</p>
	<p>In general, the educational part of the internship at the departments of the Cherkasy Medical Academy is conducted in 5 specialties, namely:
		<ol>
			<li>Anesthesiology and intensive care - 3 years;</li>
			<li>Surgery - 3 years;</li>
			<li>Internal diseases - 2 years;</li>
			<li>General practice of family medicine - 2 years;</li>
			<li>Neurology - 2 years;</li>
		</ul>

	</p>
	<p>But in the end, I decided that I didn't want to move on to medicine, as I always wanted to be an architect.</p>

					<p>On June 27, 2022, a Russian missile hit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremenchuk_shopping_mall_attack#/maplink/0" target="_blanc">Amstor shopping center</a> during a rocket attack. 21 people were killed and 59 injured. All that remains is the scrap metal from the building and the ruined human lives...</p>
					<p><a href="Russian missile">Here</a> you can see more information about this attack on Wikipedia</p>

					<p>Those who died that day will never be brought back, the only thing we can do is remember them and this crime. But the building is different, what was destroyed can be restored, moreover, it can be made even better! That is why I chose this place for my graduation project.</p>

					<p>A brief background: long ago, as in fairy tales, this site was used as a park. It was part of the largest park in Kremenchuk. And more recently, there was the Amstor shopping center, which is now just ashes... Since both of these functions are very important, I wanted to combine them. In my idea, a park will appear on the roof of the building, which can be accessed directly from the ground. And the courtyard, surrounded by glass curtain walling systems, will visually unite the courtyard and the space of the shopping center as a continuation of the park. This way, people will have a new area for recreation, but at the same time retain the shopping function. There will be a place to buy delicious coffee and a place to walk with it.</p>

					<p>Yes, it's just a concept right now, but this is how I want to see Ukraine after the war.</p>

					<p>This house I designed at my sister's request. She asked me to make a family house for 4 people (parents themselves and two children). I gave her this solution based on her budget and her wishes.</p>
					<p>I will provide my working drawings below. Also full documentation can be seen on my <a href="https://www.behance.net/a60295a6" target="_blanc">Behance</a>.</p>

					<p>&quot;WHITE LINES&quot; Residential Building.</p>
					<p>Another one of my projects I did in university, &quot;WHITE LINES&quot; Residential Building</p>

					<p>On the first floor located various shops and a pharmacy. –°ommercial premises and residential sections have different entrances. Entrances for residents are separated by decorative portals.</p>

					<p>Smooth elongated lines lengthen the facade, add dynamics and aesthetics to it. The place for air conditioners is thought out and made with metal grids with a decorative pattern. Large windows in living rooms and badrooms open a beautiful view on the city.</p>
